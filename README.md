# How to run Ice Cream Calculator on a Mac using Wine #

Previously I have provided pre-made apps for this. However, they have become increasingly unreliable. As such I will instead provide instructions for how to do it yourself. The exact instructions depend on your version of macOS.

(If you already have downloaded a pre-made app before, there is no need to do anything. You can keep using it without any issue, unless it's broken.)

As always, I am still availible to provide help and troubleshooting via my email address (purelymail:wineflavoricecream) or on GitHub.
