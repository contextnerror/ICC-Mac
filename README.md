# How to run Ice Cream Calculator on a Mac using Wine #

Previously I have provided pre-made apps for this. However, they have become increasingly unreliable. As such I will instead provide instructions for how to do it yourself. The exact instructions depend on your version of macOS, please read the file with your macOS version in the title for specifics.

If you already have downloaded a pre-made app before, there is no need to do anything. You can keep using it without any issue, unless it's broken.

If you would like to transfer your data from an old copy to a new one, please read Transfering-data.md.

## The instructions didn't work ##

As always, I am still availible to provide help and troubleshooting via my email address (purelymail:wineflavoricecream) or on GitHub. If I can't figure it out or the whole thing looks like too much trouble, you can try [Crossover](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover), which should be simpler to set up, though not free.
