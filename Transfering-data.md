# Transfer data from one copy of ICC to another #

Navigate to the drive_c folder of your original copy of ICC with the data you want to transfer. If you were using Wineskin, this will be inside the Ice Cream Calculator app package, and if you were using MacPorts this will be in the /.wine folder.

Depnding on if you enabled "Place data folder with executable", your data will be in either `drive_c/ProgramData/Ice Cream Calculator` or `drive_c/ProgramFiles (x86)/Ice cream calculator/Data`.

Go to the drive_c folder of the copy of ICC that you want to transer your data to, and move the data from the old copy into its `drive_c/ProgramFiles (x86)/Ice cream calculator/Data` folder.
